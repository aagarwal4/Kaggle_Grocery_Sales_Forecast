# Kaggle_Grocery_Sales_Forecast
This repository includes the code for the Kaggle competition: Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting. We developed a random forest model to forecast product sales. The model code can be found [here](https://github.com/aagarwal4/Kaggle_Grocery_Sales_Forecast/blob/master/GrocerySales_06.ipynb) and the cross-validation method is implemented [here](https://github.com/aagarwal4/Kaggle_Grocery_Sales_Forecast/blob/master/GrocerySales_cross_val.ipynb).
