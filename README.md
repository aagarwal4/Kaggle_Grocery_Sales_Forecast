# Grocery Sales Forecasting (Kaggle Competition)
This repository includes the code for the Kaggle competition: [Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/favorita-grocery-sales-forecasting). 

We developed a random forest model to forecast unit sales for items sold at Favorita stores in Ecuador. The model code can be found [here](https://github.com/aagarwal4/Kaggle_Grocery_Sales_Forecast/blob/master/GrocerySales_06.ipynb) and the cross-validation method is implemented [here](https://github.com/aagarwal4/Kaggle_Grocery_Sales_Forecast/blob/master/GrocerySales_cross_val.ipynb).
